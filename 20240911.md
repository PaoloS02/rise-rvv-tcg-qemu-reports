# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-09-11

## Work completed since last report

[Results, statistics and graphs for this week](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DsFIbJVZXxaTKz7m5xrbUPOcG86KvAe7zFT4Wrc6qQQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- WP2
  - Added optimizations to `vle.v` and `vse.v` helper functions that improves performance of `memcpy` with odd numbers of bytes.
  - Started optimization of `TranslationBlock` (TB) access functions.
    - RVV calls to TB access functions are in `do_vsetvl` and `do_vsetivli`.
    - `cpu_get_tb_cpu_state` accounts for 3-24% of execution time with `memcpy`, `helper_lookup_tb_ptr` accounts for 6-46% of execution time with `memcpy`, with the larger values being for small data sizes and small vectors (all data for latest optimized QEMU).
    - our initial approach of inlining these calls didn't produce significant improvements, we continue to work on this.
  - Created initial optimization for `vsetvl` instructions, given that profiling shows that its helper accounts for 2-12% of execution time in `memcpy`.
    - no performance data let.

## Work planned for the coming two weeks

- WP2
  - Explore new approaches to optimizing `TranslationBlock` access.
  - Measure effectiveness of `vsetvl` optimization and extend this work.
  - Continue optimization of the `vle.v` and `vse.v` helper functions:

- Other
  - Following discussion with RISE, we will switch to weekly calls.
  - **Paul Walmsley** to send a follow up email about proposed tasks/priorities.
