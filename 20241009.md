# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-10-09

## Work completed since last report

- WP2
  - Compacted loop of the first Embecosm patch to 8 byte per iteration.
  - Complete SiFive library function set.
    - **Complete**
    - full results not available, due to some vector instructions triggering SIGILL with VLEN=1024 and LMUL=m8 (under investigation).
  - Continue to work on the separation of the large load/store patch.
    - **Stopped**
  - Single instruction benchmarking relevant to SiFive library functions.
    - waiting on solving the SIGILL problem.
  - Continue to work on AArch64 comparison.
    - **No further progress**
  - Analysed the glibc memcpy benchmark results presented last week by Max.
    - Embecosm's patches weren't completely included or used optimally in the presented configuration.

- Actions:
  - Max: share patches applied to our benchmarking scripts.
    **Complete**
  - Max: run SPECCPU 2017 results again with VLEN=128 and LMUL=1 and enabled OpenMP.
    **Still awaited**

## Work planned for the coming week

- WP2
  - Measure impact of 8 bytes per iteration patch (see above).
  - Single instruction benchmarking relevant to SiFive library functions.
  - Continue to work on AArch64 comparison.
  - Measure the glibc bencmark with VLEN=128/LMUL=1.
  - Work on new optimizations for vector loads/stores.
    - Identify optimizations for those of the 14 SiFve string/memory functions where the current patch shows no improvement.
