[Latest results, statistics and graphs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DsFIbJVZXxaTKz7m5xrbUPOcG86KvAe7zFT4Wrc6qQQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- WP2
  - Explore new approaches to optimizing `TranslationBlock` access.
    - Deferred to prioritize vle/vse optimization.
  - Measure effectiveness of `vsetvl` optimization and extend this work.
    - Deferred to prioritize vle/vse optimization.
  - Continue optimization of the `vle.v` and `vse.v` helper functions.
    - **In progress** set up of comparison tests with ARM.
    - **In progress** optimization of the vle/vse helper function loop for odd data sizes.

## Work planned for the coming week

- WP2
  - Enlarge testsuite with more memory benchmarks.
  - Explore small block loads/stores optimizations.

## Changes since start of project

It is useful to keep an idea of what we have achieved since 1 May 2024. We use ns/instruction as our metric.

| Metric                  |    Start |   Now | Speedup | Notes        |
|:------------------------|---------:|------:|--------:|:-------------|
| `memcpy` worst case     |     6.84 |  5.06 |     35% |              |
| `memcpy` best case      | 2,594.12 | 72.28 |  3,588% | 8,192 bytes  |
| SPEC CPU 2017 average   |      TBC | 11.30 |       - |              |
| SPEC CPU 2017 best case |    12.35 |  7.42 |     66% | `628.pop2_s` |

Percentage changes relative to "now".  SPEC CPU 2017 results are from August, since we have stopped measuring this.

The SPEC CPU 2017 average needs checking, since the set of benchmarks which ran successfully is different.

# Planned absences
